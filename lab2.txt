The arguments passed to socket() are constants used to specify 
the address family and socket type.
AF_INET: the Internet address family for IPv4. 
SOCK_STREAM: the socket type for TCP, the protocol that will be used to transport messages in the network.

2.
The way to specify a client or a server socket is the same ,using socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM).
A client socket make connections to a server and send data to it.
A server socket listen for requests coming in, and respond to them.

3.
the second parameter(socket.SO_REUSEADDR) of setsockopt function allows the server to reuse the same ip and port, 
while it's in close-wait or time-wait state.

4.
